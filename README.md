## Introduction

This web app is a social media inspired by Twitter, posts are not allowed to include punctuation or capital letters - this is to attempt to increase informallity in speech (this is mainly to differentiate from Twitter).

## Installation and setup

`npm i`
`npm run build:css`
`npm run seed`
`npm start`
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Design Inspirations

Front-end renderer inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Back-end Models inspired by Laravel, MVC architecture, JSON database inspired by MongoDB

## Styling

This app uses Tailwind css libary to style the front-end.

Therefore I did modify premade components from https://v1.tailwindcss.com/components/.
